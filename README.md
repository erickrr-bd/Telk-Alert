Telk-Alert is an application to alert about anomalies or patterns of interest in the data stored in ElasticSearch.

Telk-Alert was born as an initiative to have a tool that could alert about possible security events that need to be monitored 24/7.

If you have data in ElasticSearch in real time and need to be alerted when certain events occur, Telk-Alert is the tool for you.

# Applications

- You can enable or not the validation of the SSL certificate.
- It works with any index or index pattern.
- The search in ElasticSearch is done through "Query String".
- Match where there are at least X events in Y time" (frequency type).
- The alert can be sent to a specific telegram channel.
- N alert rules can be configured, each with a specific purpose.
- You can configure the search so that it only shows specific fields of the event.
- Use of "custom rules", for example, to configure an alert rule that alerts failed logins when they are on the same host and by the same user.
- For security reasons, a user is created for the Telk-Alert service to work with.
- In case of finding more than one event, the alert can be configured to send only one message and the total number of events or one message for each event found.
- Parse data that will be sent in the alert to give you a better view.
- Generation of application logs.
