Telk-Alert is an application developed in Python, which is responsible for sending alerts via Telegram, based on searches in ElasticSearch using query string.

# Applications

Characteristics:
- The connection with ElasticSearch can be done through HTTPS and HTTP authentication (It must be configured in ElasticSearch).
- It has been tested to work with the indices generated by Auditbeat, Winlogbeat and Filebeat.
- The search in ElasticSearch is done through Query String.
- The sending of alerts can be sent to a Telegram channel or to one or more email addresses or both.
- The searches are carried out every certain configurable time. Which translates into 24/7 monitoring.
- N alert rules can be configured, each with a specific purpose.
- Generation of application logs both in a file and in an index in ElasticSearch.
- For security reasons, a user is created for the Telk-Alert service to work with.
- Sending alerts restricted by a certain number of events by hostname (For example, for failed user logins).
- Sending alerts restricted by a certain number of fields, that is, it does not send all the information about the event, but only sends the fields that were configured in the alert rule.
- In case of finding more than one event, the alert can be configured to send only one message and the total number of events or one message for each event found.
- Parse data that will be sent in the alert to give you a better view.

## Telk-Alert-Tool
Telk-Alert graphical tool that allows the user to define the configuration and alert rules that will be used for the operation of the application. These data are saved in files with the extension yaml.

- Allows you to create and modify the Telk-Alert-Agent configuration.
- Allows you to start, restart, stop and get the status of the Telk-Alert-Agent service.

## Telk-Alert-Agent
Telk-Alert auxiliary tool that allows to validate the status of the Telk-Alert service and send an alert.

Characteristics:
